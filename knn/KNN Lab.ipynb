glass dataset, dropped the ID column (since it has unique values for each row), and normalized the rest of the features. Then I split the data into train and test sets, and ran the model on three random splits to get an average accuracy. With the default values, the train and test accuracy was a little bit better than random, but not by much. I also printed out the probabilites one time, and the voting method was clear. Each probability is a multiple of 0.2, so each closest neighbor gave 0.2 votes, and the highest one won. I then experimented with different p values. The p value didn't seem to effect the training set much, with accuracies bouncing between 0.708 and 0.737, but the testing set accurcy did consistently decrease as the p value increased.
